# VertexCover_MILP_GA
Finding minimal vertex cover of a graph by genetic algorithm
CalVertexCoverMain.m is the main MATLAB file to execute.
Data_to_Calculate.xlsx contains the vertex-edge information of the conducted experiments.
In the CalVertexCoverMain.m file, at line number 5, in the for loop the range specifies the number of rows of Data_to_Calculate.xlsx to be considered for the execution instance
